Thanks for buying my asset!

My package toon shaders Requires Unity 5.X or higher(Works with Unity 5.5.1f1).

Powerful and complete set of stylized toon shaders.

Because of copyright issues, the role's model and textures are not provided in the scene.

PostEffect (Requires Unity 5.3 or higher) 

Notes:

1 - UV coords are mainly important for vertex colors e.g space between them is not used. The exceptions to this are the detail textures (e.g logo image), inner lines and shadow map texture.

2 - The shadow map texture is optional (can be replaced with vertex colors).

3 - The Color texture is used for the base color and is multiplied by the SSS texture to get dark areas.

4 - The combined texture uses the following color channels:
    Red:   specular intensity.
    Green: shadow map. 
    Blue:  specular size
    Alpha: interior lines.
 
5 - The vertex color channels are used for shadows.

6 - Interior lines use a special UV layout for smooth edges.
